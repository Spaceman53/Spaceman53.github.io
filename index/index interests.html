            I absolutely love Star Wars &copy;. I originally hated it as it was popular but when my parents
            showed me the movies I loved them. I like the Prequel's a lot more then the rest mostly to do with
            Clone Wars tv show. <br />  But the hole of Star Wars &copy; (except the sequels) I love if the sci fi
            elements and references to real life history will still feeling unique.

            When I am not working I like to play video games in my free time. I play all kind of games from souls likes to real time strategy games.
            I use my computer which I have built to play them as I specifically built it to run games and it is inddeed good at that. I have
            had no problems with it and I continue to upgrade it when I need to.
