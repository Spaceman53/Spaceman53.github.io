            Space is the next and most dangerous domain for humanity to explore with no seeable end.
            A challenge like no other that can be found on earth with environment that seen to alien
            to be in the same universe as us. <br /> But we are but a small ant in the open ocean that is the
            milky way we know nothing of our own ocean so the few thing we know about space is likely
            much smaller then we are said to belive.

            The depths of space are full of both the new and unknown to solutions to many problems found here on earth.
            For example asteroids. Asterodids are full of raw materials that can be found on Earth and with larger deposits with in them.
            Asterodids also can have ice with in them which can be brought back to Earth and made into water, stopping the most likely reson for
            war in the future the fight over water.

            Another thing space have is well space, Not only can we colonize other planets but also make use of the colossus space between the planet
            to make space stations. These station could act as generalized hubs to being specialized structures for industry, research institutions, to residential space.
            The possibilities are endless as thing like land will no longer a problem.
